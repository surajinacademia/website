Hi! I am Suraj.
PhD Candidate in Gopinathan Lab at University of California Merced. I am a computational physicist by training and I am interested in understanding the intricacies of how life works. I motivated by the processes of self-organization and how that makes life so beautiful. I study how physical interactions between the cells and with their surrounding ECM lead to formation and remodeling of multicellular networks. For example, Blood Vascular Development
Before joining UC Merced I did my Masters from National Institute of Technology.
